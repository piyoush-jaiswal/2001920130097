I have pushed folders to github, and saw a white arrow on one of my folders this morning. and when i click on the folder, it does not open it. later I found the reason that folder contains another git folder in it that's why it is not opening so, I deleted that mfile from my local pc and changed my folder name and again added my folder to the repository

I am honest to my act and ensures that no cheating has been done.
